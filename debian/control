Description: fast, high-quality magnification filter for pixel art
 hqx ("hq" stands for "high quality" and "x" stands for magnification)
 is one of the pixel art scaling algorithms developed by Maxim Stepin,
 used in emulators such as Nestopia, bsnes, ZSNES, Snes9x, FCE Ultra
 and many more. There are 3 hqx filters: hq2x, hq3x and hq4x which
 magnify by factor of 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
